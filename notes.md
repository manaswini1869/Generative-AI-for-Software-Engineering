What is GenAI?
- GenAI can generate a working code, but you need to know how to properly use Gen AI to generate working software systems
- Generative AI reference to Artificial Intelligence Systems that can generate new contents eg: everything from code snippets to fully rendered images and synthetic media like videos and music
- Co-pilot : assists in coding, it suggests entire lines of code as you write couple of lines of code
Search Engines, IDE, debugging tools
- Not just a tool to create content faster, paradigm shift on how you can approach solution to problems in software development a way to automate and enhance the product and reducing time from concept to product
AI and Machine Learning
- AI is a concept of programming a computer to react to data in a similar way to a thinking being
- Features are the input
- Program to look at all the features that we humans perceive and interpret it
- Machine Learning fancy new way to program a computer, new and different methodology of computer programming
- Example: giving computer the answers to the questions, giving the proper data for the relevant activity
- Make a guess -> measure your accuracy -> optimize your guess and keep repeating the process
- Using tensor flow you will have the API that the model can work out the patterns in the data
Supervised Learning
- backbone of the systems that require reliable and accurate predictions based on the past data
- mapping the data, input data paired with the correct output data,each question comes with an answer
- LLms are built by using supervised learning (a->B) to repeatedly predict the next word
- When we train a very large AI system on a lot of data (hundreds of billions of words), we get a Large Language Model like ChatGPT
Transformer
- Game changer, they paved the way to revolution on the path to become a software developer
- Neural Network predict the patterns, they are able to predict what would happen next in the system as oppose to predicting what they see
- Transformer process all the data simultaneously, parallel processing speed of the training as well as understanding the dependency in the long range texts
- Key Concepts of Transformer:
    - Attention: Allows the model to focus on specific words when predicting the next word, considers the relation between the concept and the predicting word, text is broken down into token
        - vector embeddings, multiple attention blocks and the embedding are updated repeatedly, details about the words of the sentences are updated
        - generate semantically appropriate words
    - Encoders and decoders : Components of the model architecture that prepare and process text
        - before modifying, understand the entire model, focus more on the parts which will effect the functionality of the code more and after processing, the encoder will convert the tokens into context vectors
        - decoder reverses the process, it will try to predict what to code next, artificial understanding
- an excellent algorithm which is able to understand the relevance between the data and the information you have inputted into the system and which will help you in the development of the model properly and also quickly completing the project
- The higher the quality of data you inputted the better the output you will get from the model
